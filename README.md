cd secure-file-sharing

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
(Keeps Python packages organized)
python -m venv venv
Windows: Run venv\Scripts\activate

Mac/Linux: Run source venv/bin/activate

2. Deployment Plan (For Going Live)

1. Choose a Host (Pick one)
Railway.app (Easiest) â†’ railway.app

Heroku (Free) â†’ heroku.com

2. Prepare Your Project
Install:
pip install gunicorn whitenoise psycopg2-binary python-dotenv
Create .env file:
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
Update settings.py (use os.getenv() for secrets).

3. Deploy on Railway (Fastest)
Sign up at Railway.app.

Upload code (drag & drop or GitHub).

Set SECRET_KEY in "Variables" tab.

Run:
railway run python manage.py migrate
railway run python manage.py createsuperuser
Done! Your site is live.

Or Deploy on Heroku
Sign up at Heroku.

Run:
heroku create
git push heroku main
heroku run python manage.py migrate
Done! 

Keep Secure
Never share .env or SECRET_KEY.

Use DEBUG=False in production.

Your app is now live!
